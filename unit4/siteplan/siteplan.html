    <h3>Dynamic Elements</h3>
    <p>
        There will be a dynamic sorting menu on the left side of all the products filled with a price range,
        certain tags, or other elements that will provide as a mechanism to find what's needed. There will
        also be a page for each item in the catalog, utilizing ids to create the page for the item when
        clicked on in the grid.

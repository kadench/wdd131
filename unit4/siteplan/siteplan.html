    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        The purpose of this website is to create a shopping catalog page that can mimic ones found in real
        life, and allow people to go through and see what clothing might interest them.
    </p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
        This website will be tailored to adults 16 and up who want to shop for cheap clothing. It will provide
        a somewhat modern website design that will attempt to be easy to navigate.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Dynamic Elements</h3>
    <p>
        There will be a dynamic sorting menu on the left side of all the products filled with a price range,
        certain tags, or other elements that will provide as a mechanism to find what's needed.

    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/e9c46a-3a405a-759aab-e07a5f"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/e9c46a-3a405a-759aab-e07a5f</a>

    <table class="colors">
      <tr>
        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent 1</th>
        <th>Accent 2</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">#E9C46A</td>
        <td class="secondary">#30405A</td>
        <td class="accent1">#759AAB</td>
        <td class="accent2">#E07A5F</td>

    </table>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 10-12------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Typography</h3>

      Heading Font: Lato

    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to My Board Game where I show you my progress on my personal
      Monopoly game I like to call <strong><i>Massive Monopoly</i></strong>!
      On this website, you will find a simple overview of my design process,
      the colors and applications I chose to use, and how to contact me if
      you have any questions.
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      My Monopoly version has been three years in the making. It's not done.
      However, I plan to continue working on it again when the burnout wares
      off. I have to finish some components of the game and then it'll be good
      for play testing.
    </p>
